# Look-Alike-Model

This model is able to take people labled as customers (people who have already bought from the brand or company), then find new potential customers similar to those given customers in a database. Then it measures the potential customers from 1% to 90% similarity to the given customers. It can also be used to find new customers based on past customers and be able to tell you the characteristics of your customers (age, location, hobbies, etc)
